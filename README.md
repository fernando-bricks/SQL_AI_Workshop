# SQL_AI_Workshop
###  Objective of the workshop:
This hands-on workshop is designed to empower data analysts, engineers, and business users to extract maximum value from their refined, business-ready datasets using Databricks' unified analytics platform. The "Gold Layer" refers to the curated, high-quality data tier in the medallion architecture that's optimized for analytics and reporting.

- An organization that's looking to accelerate the extraction of insights 
- New Databricks Customers  or new users of the platform that have gold layer info
- Databricks users who are expanding their use of the platform, more focus on insights extraction
- Customers on the migration to the Gold layer first path

### Prerequirements:
- UC enable, SQL Serverless  or SQL Pro
- The dataset should contain a text column in one of the tables
- If possible, a time series dataset
- ai_forecast() preview enabled 
- Dataset with at least three different gold layer tables*
- The data should be on UC-managed tables *This is for the PoC 

### What's in it for you:
- A ready-made lab environment for student experimentation, accessed with a notebook and the corresponding dataset needed
- 1-2 hours of live virtual instruction, dedicated to your organization 

### Agenda(1-2 hours):
- SQL warehouses (5 min)
- Load data + UC catalog Managed tables (10 min)
- Notebook exploration for SQL EDA (15 min)
- Batch Inference to enrrich data (10 min)
- Dashboard Creation (15 min)
- Genie set up (10 min)
- AIBI Dashboard + Genie (1min)

### Key Outcomes:
Become empowered users of DBSQL and understand the main concepts of warehouses in Databricks
Understatement on how to leverage UC managed tables, Dashboards, and genie to quickly productionize the process of insights extraction from your gold layer
Be capable of using batch inferences for insight extraction and data enrichment
